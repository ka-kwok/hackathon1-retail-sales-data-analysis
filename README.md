## Dataset Content
* Dataset used in this anaylsis is the historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.

* There are 3 datasets â€“ Stores, Features and Sales. For more details please visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjeetsingh/retaildataset


## Business Requirements
* Sales Performance Analysis

    * Compare performance across stores, departments to identify top- and low-performing stores/departments.

* Promotion Effectiveness

    * Measure the impact of markdowns, holidays, and seasonal promotions on weekly sales and recommend optimal promotion strategies.


* Seasonality & Trend Detection

    * Identify sales patterns by week, month, quarter, and year to determine holiday season trends.

* Operational Planning

    * Support inventory and staffing decisions with accurate demand insights.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
1. Weekly sales are significantly higher during holidays.
    * Answer:
2. Promotions/markdowns positively impact sales, especially in peak seasons.
    * Answer:
3. Larger stores generate higher sales.
    * Answer:
4. Economic factors (fuel price, CPI, unemployment) influence sales.
    * Answer:
5. Sales follow seasonal patterns with specific quarterly/monthly peaks.
    * Answer:

## Project Plan
* 1.  ETL
    * Data Extraction
    * Data Transformation
    * Data Load
2. Data Visualization
    * Matplotlib
    * Seaborn
    * plotly
3. Data Analysis and Findings

* How was the data managed throughout the collection, processing, analysis and interpretation steps?
* Why did you choose the research methodologies you used?

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

## Ethical considerations
Although there were no data privacy (PII), bias, or fairness issues with the dataset, the following principles were always followed:

* Data Privacy: Any personally identifiable information (PII) was anonymized or removed to protect individual privacy.

* Bias and Fairness: The dataset was reviewed for representation bias, and adjustments were made to prevent disadvantaging any group.

* Legal Compliance: Data collection and processing adhered to all applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

* Societal Impact: Potential misuse or negative consequences were considered, and safeguards were implemented to mitigate risks.

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 
    *  Regarding the demand forecasting, it is essential to  develop models to predict future sales using historical data and external features (temperature, fuel prices, CPI, unemployment, etc.). Further ML techniques for forecasting are to be developed.


## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
